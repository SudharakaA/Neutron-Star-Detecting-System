🌌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect neutron stars — specifically pulsars ⭐️, which are rapidly rotating neutron stars emitting periodic radio signals 📡. By analyzing radio frequency data with Python’s powerful libraries, including OpenCV for image processing and advanced signal processing tools, this project explores methods to identify periodic signals that characterize neutron stars. Neutron stars are the incredibly dense remains of supernova explosions 💥, and pulsars, a unique type of neutron star, emit regular bursts of radiation detectable by radio telescopes. 🌠

🎯 Objectives
📊 Analyze radio signal data to identify periodic emissions typical of neutron stars.
🧠 Develop algorithms that process, filter, and detect significant signal patterns using techniques like Fourier Transform, autocorrelation, and other signal processing methods.
🎨 Visualize and validate detected signals through plotting and frequency analysis to gain clear insights.
